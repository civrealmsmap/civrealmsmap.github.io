# How to contribute VoxelMap data

> Note that this will contain only the terrain data, and no waypoints.

First of all, quit the server and wait a bit, so the map data files are written to your disk. Now open the map data cache directory:

Windows: go to `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods\VoxelMods\voxelMap\cache`

Mac: go to `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods/VoxelMods/voxelMap/cache`

Then create a .7z, .zip, or .rar archive containing the directory of the server (e.g. civrealms.com), and send it over Discord: @Raven#0971. If it's a lot of data, you might need to upload it to a file hosting service of your choice (for example PixelDrain or MediaFire).

Done! Thank you for contributing. You will always be remembered.
